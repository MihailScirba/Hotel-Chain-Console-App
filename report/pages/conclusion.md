The hotel chain management simulation successfully met its objectives by enhancing proficiency in Java OOP, the Collections Framework, and Java I/O operations. The project demonstrated the effective use of object-oriented principles, modular class design, and efficient data handling through collections. Additionally, it implemented Java I/O for data persistence, ensuring that hotel data was saved and retrieved seamlessly.

The system's design allows for scalability across multiple hotels and ensures maintainability through clean code structure and error handling. This project provided practical, hands-on experience in building a robust Java application, laying the groundwork for future enhancements.
