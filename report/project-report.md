## Introduction

>Bellow is the "Hotel Chain" Console Application used for its management. Hotel chain has a few branches, each branch can include one or more hotels. Each hotels has an amount of rooms with different comfort levels like "standard", "semi-luxury" or "luxury". As well, like any hotel, it has clients who want to offer a room for a certain period. Of course they can do it. Here is no used database intergration, therefore here are used Java I/O for reading data from txt files, but only is read. Data is not writting in files. They include starting data for being able to interact with the program and execute all provided options. All data is stored by Java Collections Framework. For more detailed description keep reading the whole report or navigate to the code.

## Project Objective

>This project will follow, more than that, a main improvement to the student's understanding and application with regard to the core Java concepts: object-oriented programming, the Collections Framework, input/output operations, etc. The student shall have to design and implement a system in which such elements can be used in practice, showing a solution to a real-world problem robustly, scalably, and efficiently. The focus is on bettering one's coding via extensive practice, adhering to best practices in developing a modular, reusable, and maintainable Java application.

## Project scopes

### Project Scope

#### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* Design a system based on real-life entities, using the four basic principles of OOP, that is, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

* Require the implementation to begin with the well-defined classes for the system components and specifically define in them: constructors, methods, access modifiers, fields.

* Establish relationships between classes--such as association, aggregation, and composition--and use
inheritance hierarchies correctly.

* Use interfaces and abstract classes whenever it's possible to get to know polymorphism and patterns.

#### 2. Collections Framework

* So, the next instructions will be dealing with different Java collections: ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and LinkedList.

* It looks into the relative performance strengths that different collection types have and where to use which.

* Handle scenarios that call for the use of concurrent collections and, where relevant, consider multi-threading.

#### 3. Java Input/Output (I/O)

* Java File Input and Output Use file input and output: Java's I/O package: java.nio.File.Path
* Creation and maintenance of file directories including the deletion and alteration of files.

* Add in exception handling to make the file handling robust. Finally, ensure that resources are closed using try-with-resources or an equivalent mechanism.

#### 4. Error Handling

* Rich error handling using Java's exception handling mechanisms such as try-catch, throws, and custom exceptions.
